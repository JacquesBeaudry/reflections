How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It narrows the number of lines needed to scan to find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It means I can easily try things to evaluate several options and choose the best.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual saves means you get to make them logically consistent.  The downside is you may overdo it or not do it often enough.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git expects the files to be related to each other, not Google Docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will give me changes committed to the repo. Git diff will give me the difference beween 2 commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because version control allows me to easily correct whatever I broke.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use git for all my projects, even the non-programming ones.
